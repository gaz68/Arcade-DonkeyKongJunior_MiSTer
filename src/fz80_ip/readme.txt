fz80 ver.1.01 + (SUB+DAA) bugfix

The fz80.v is "Z80 CPU binary compatible soft core" written by Y.Kuwahara.
This core is much smaller than the core of other Z80 cores,
and a bus cycle is carried out with single clock like KC80 series.
This was made for the FPGA clone of PC8001(Japanese Classic PC).
